### Abstract of the experiment
In this lab, we generate random numbers using Monte-Carlo Simulations with a lin-
ear probability distribution and Gaussian distribution, whereas Gaussian distribution
is composed of uniform and exponential distribution. 70% of our data fit the linear
model, and for the other set of data, 95.7% of the data lies within two standard devia-
tions from the mean and therefore fit the Gaussian distribution. Our results also show
the central limit theorem, with both mean and standard deviation converging to their
true value for increasing sample size.
